# pyprocgen

Just a procedural map generator made in Python3 for fun.

## EXAMPLE OF MAP GENERATED:

!Example of map generated - if not show look at concept-art/example_of_map.png](concept-art/example_of_map.png)

## WHAT IT DOES:

For now it only creates a .ppm picture of a map with procedural generation using Perlin noise. Maybe it will be able to create a png picture later.

## HOW TO USE IT ?

1. Download the project
2. Run pyprocgen.py with Python3
3. Enter the width then the height of the map you want, in pixels
4. Choose the mode you want to use and change options (optional)
5. Wait during processing
6. Open generated_map.ppm with your image manager, that will be create on the current folder (if it doesn't open then use your Office editor to open it)
7. Enjoy :)

## LANGUAGE:

-   User interface and code are in english.
-   Comments are only in french for the time being (maybe an english version will comes later).

## SPECIAL THANKS:

To [mindstorm38](https://github.com/mindstorm38), [icanwalkonwater](https://github.com/icanwalkonwater) and 0xfada for their help about a lot of things, this project probably wouldn't be nice without them.
