# Procedural_generation_2D
Just a 2D procedural generation made in Python3 for fun.


WHAT IT DOES:
----------
For now it only creates a .ppm picture of a map with procedural generation using Perlin noise. Maybe it will be able to create a png picture later.


HOW TO USE IT ?
----------

- run procedural_generation_2D with Python3
- enter the width (x) then the height (y) of the map you want, in pixels
- wait during processing
- open Generated_map.ppm with your image manager (if it doesn't work then use your Office text editor to open it)
- enjoy ;)


LANGUAGE:
----------
- User Interface is in english.
- Comments are only in french for the time being (maybe an english version will comes later).


NAMING STYLE:
----------
I didn't use the real Python's naming conventions in this project because I think some of them aren't compatible with my way of naming, so this is a little alias to clearly understand them if you didn't:

- v_  : variable
- fi_ : file
- cl_ : class
- f_  : function
- m_  : method
- p_  : package
